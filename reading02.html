            Why Nations Fail<br />The Orgins Of Power, Prosperity, And Poverty
          </h2>
          <h3>Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson</h3>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Acemoglu and Robinson emphasize the crucial role of political
              institutions in shaping economic outcomes.
            </strong>
            Inclusive institutions promote broad-based participation in
            political and economic life, fostering innovation and prosperity.
            Extractive institutions, on the other hand, concentrate power and
            wealth in the hands of a small elite, hindering economic
            development.<br />
            In this book, a wide range of historical examples are drawed to
            support its arguments, from North and South Korea to divergent
            development of England and Spain.<br />
            This book give me an another way to observe a nation. And somehow it
            gives me a support to my intuition about the relationship between
            political and economic growing.

            The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is
            Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness
          </h2>
          <h3>Jonathan Haidt</h3>
          <p>
            It is an important book that delves into the alarming rise of mental
            health issues among young people in recent years. Haidt argues that
            this crisis is largely due to the "great rewiring" of childhood
            caused by the pervasive influence of smartphones and social media,
            coupled with overprotective parenting in the real world.<br />
            I am surprised that how new techonlogy change our life, spicetify in
            mental life. I am one of the Gen Z but I am not commonly use and
            post something on social media. After reading, I will think twice
            before submitting a post or comment. I also recommend parents and
            educators to read it.

          <h2>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</h2>
          <h3>Thomas Piketty</h3>
          <p>
            It is a groundbreaking book that has had a significant impact on the
            debate about inequality. It provides a valuable framework for
            understanding the dynamics of wealth accumulation and offers
            important insights into the challenges facing contemporary
            capitalism. While the book has its limitations, it is undoubtedly a
            significant contribution to our understanding of economic inequality
            and deserves to be widely read and discussed.
