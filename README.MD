# Tommy Wong Personal Website

Hi everyone, welcome to my website!

This is my first website while I am learning the basic HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap5.

So it may not be a very beautiful and well design website.

Hope I can improve in the coming future.

It has **four** different part:

1. Home Page

2. Habit

3. Readingüìñ

4. Game CenterüïπÔ∏è

## Home Page

![home_page](/img/home_page.png "home page")

In home page, a short of my history and a photo in Vancouverüòé.

Below that, there shows my programming skills.

## Habit

![habit_stable_diffusion](/img/habit_SD.png "habit page")

In here, I used JS to create three different cards.

And user can click the arrow icon to change between three card and the images inside the card.

I also create a background music on this page to share my favorite music‚ù§Ô∏èüé∂.

## Reading

![reading_page](/img/reading.png "reading page")

For reading page, a few books have been shared.

There are two styles to show the information.

1. Table Style (write in HTML table)

2. Card Style (write in CSS Flex style)

I have read other books in my life but those books are my favorite.

## Game Center

Welcome to my game center!

There has **_five_** games you can try.

1. Circle Cross ‚≠ï‚ùå

   1. Player VS Player

   2. Player VS Computer

2. Breakout

3. Minesweeper

4. Trivia

5. Gomoku

![game_center](/img/game_center.png "game center")

When I was building those games, I learned a lot of JS skills.

Breakout still has a bug even I asked AI to help me‚ò†Ô∏è.

**SO THERE IS A FEATURE**

**SO THERE IS A FEATURE**

**SO THERE IS A FEATURE**

This is very important so I need to say it thrice.

_Maybe_ there has some bug which I didn't find themüòú.

By the way, you can beat computer in my circle crossüòâ.

In Trivia, I use an API to get the question.

In Gomoku, I am going to write a minimax algorithm for PVE but now there is only PVP mode.

If the algorithm has been completed, it will be my highlightü§©.

## Short Summary

In this project, I used basic HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap5 icons to build my personal website. At the beginning, I planned to create a few games to learn the coding skill in JS. They are:

1. Circle Cross

2. Breakout

3. Minesweeper

4. Trivia

5. Gomoku

Beside the games, I also improved the habit page with JS. Animation, background music have been added on that page.

## Difficulties

1. Alert problems

   - In the past, I used an alert function to tell something to the user. But the alert function will stop the whole DOM so some event can not run after an alert.

   - At the end, a pop-up card was inserted so the DOM can run while the user gets some message.

2. Complex animation effects and event listener problems

   - Since animation effects need some time to run, some functions have been started but those elements have not been created or shown on the screen.

   - Add a setTimeout to those functions that can run after those elements have been created.

3. Unable to solve a bug

   - In the breakout, if the bag hits the board at the side, the bag may go inside the board.

   - The collision function needs to be improved in future. Like not using changing the movement direction method. Using change the speed of the ball during collision.

# Wins

1. Fast response

   - In all the pages with JS, it does not need too much time to load.

   - The responses are very fast. Users will not feel delayed while playing those games.

2. Learn more about APIs

   - Two APIs are used: onYouTubeIframeAPIReady and openTriviaDatabase.

3. Figure out how to use Async function

   - Create HTML element and control animation effects in JS

   - In the habit page, try to use only one container to show three different cards.
