# Tommy Wong Personal Website

Hi everyone, welcome to my website!

This is my first website while I am learning the basic HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap5.

So it may not be a very beautiful and well design website.

Hope I can improve in the coming future.

It has **four** different part:

1. Home Page

2. Habit

3. Reading📖

4. Game Center🕹️

## Home Page

In home page, a short of my history and a photo in Vancouver😎.

Below that, there shows my programming skills.

## Habit

In here, I used JS to create three different cards.

And user can click the arrow icon to change between three card and the images inside the card.

I also create a background music on this page to share my favorite music❤️🎶.

## Reading

For reading page, a few books have been shared.

There are two styles to show the information.

1. Table Style (write in HTML table)

2. Card Style (write in CSS Flex style)

I have read other books in my life but those books are my favorite.

> It does not mean I don't want to write a review for all books😜

## Game Center

Welcome to my game center!

There has **_four_** games you can try.

1. Circle Cross ⭕❌

   1. Player VS Player

   2. Player VS Computer

2. Breakout

3. Minesweeper

4. Trivia

When I was building those games, I learned a lot of JS skills.

Breakout still has a bug even I asked AI to help me☠️.

**SO THERE IS A FEATURE**

**SO THERE IS A FEATURE**

**SO THERE IS A FEATURE**

This is very important so I need to say it thrice.

_Maybe_ there has some bug which I didn't find them😜.

By the way, you can beat computer in my circle cross😉.

In Trivia, I use an API to get the question.
